# Architecture Decisions

## Overview
This platform is designed for extensibility, performance, and maintainability, leveraging modern web and AI technologies.

## System Components

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Material-UI, Monaco Editor.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, MongoDB via Mongoose.
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live collaboration and notifications.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication with route protection.
- **Analysis Pipeline**:
  - **JavaScript**: ESLint-based rules.
  - **Python**: Pylint integration.
  - **C#**: Roslyn-based static analysis.
  - **Security Scanner**: Regex-driven heuristics to catch insecure patterns.
  - **AI Analysis**: OpenAI GPT integration with in-memory caching (`node-cache`) and rate limiting (`Bottleneck`).

## Caching & Rate Limiting
- **Cache Layer**: In-memory caching of AI suggestions to reduce API calls and improve performance. TTL is configurable via `AI_CACHE_TTL_SEC`.
- **Rate Limiter**: Bottleneck ensures adherence to OpenAI rate limits, configurable via `OPENAI_RESERVOIR` and `OPENAI_MIN_TIME_MS`.

## Microservice & Modularity
- Each analysis tool (ESLint, Pylint, Roslyn, AI, security scanner) is encapsulated in its own module for ease of testing and extension.
- Express routers are organized by domain (auth, reviews, comments, analysis, feedback) for clear separation of concerns.

## Deployment
- Docker Compose scripts manage multi-container setups (backend, frontend, database).
- Environment variables centralize configuration for different environments (development, test, production).
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates linting, testing, building, and deployment on pull requests and merges to maintain code quality and catch issues early.
- **Hosting**: Frontend is deployed to static hosts (e.g., Netlify, Vercel); backend runs in Docker containers orchestrated via Docker Compose (development) and Kubernetes or ECS (production).

## Logging & Monitoring
- **Backend**: Winston (or custom logger) captures error and info logs.
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest for API integration and unit tests.

## Contribution & Code Quality
- Codestyle enforced with Prettier and ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Comprehensive test coverage with Jest (JavaScript), Pytest (Python), XUnit (C#).
